# Introduction
This repo holds the LaTeX source files and the final .pdf thesis format.  
For my Dissertation Thesis i am using a certain template that i do not want to modify in any way.  
Because of this, the only editable file, from the template, will be the main.tex file. The rest of the files will have chmod 400 on them, meaning they will only have read permissions, butno write permissions.  
By doing so, i prevent any accidental editing of my template.  
For this i needed a Linux filesystem(i am using BTRFS on an Arch-Linux machine) to be able to set permissions.
